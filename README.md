# Spaceship Asteroid Arcade

A retro-futuristic arcade game where you pilot a spaceship through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions and shooting asteroids to survive. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

- **Move**: Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to navigate the spaceship.
- **Shoot**: Press `Space` to fire lasers. Lasers have a cooldown period.
- **Hyperspace**: Press `H` to teleport randomly (limited uses). Beware: a small chance of malfunction!
- **Objective**: Avoid asteroids and fragments while shooting them to score points. Larger asteroids give more points.

## Features

- **Retro-Futuristic Design**: Styled spaceship and asteroids using pure CSS.
- **Parallax Starfield**: Dynamic background for depth and immersion.
- **Asteroid Destruction**: Asteroids break into fragments when shot.
- **Hyperspace**: Teleport with a risk of malfunction.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Asteroids become faster and more frequent over time.
- **Game Over**: Lose lives on collisions. Game ends when lives reach zero.

## Game Mechanics

- **Lives**: Start with 3 lives. Collisions reduce lives.
- **Scoring**: Earn points for destroying asteroids. Larger asteroids = more points.
- **Cooldown**: Lasers have a recharge time indicated by a cooldown bar.
- **Hyperspace Limit**: Use hyperspace wisely—it has limited uses and a recharge time.

## Code Structure

- Single HTML file with organized, commented JavaScript.
- Smooth performance optimized for many asteroids and fragments.

## Bonus Challenge

Hyperspace adds a risk-reward element: teleport randomly but with a small chance of malfunction (e.g., teleporting into an asteroid).
